be constructed order to integrate hydroponic system or you can just install them wherever empty space are available ` am growing some tomatoes in deutch bucket and i want to know if i have to leave the air pump on or just before the water pump nb i water the plants mn times a day ` this study focused on the development of a smart greenhouse system for hydroponic gardens with the adaptation of the internet of things and monitored through mobile as one of the solutions towards the negative effects of the worlds booming population never ending shrinking of arable lands and the effect of climate change drastically in our environments to achieve the goal of the study the researchers created an actual hydroponic greenhouse system with completely developing plants and automation in examining and monitoring the water ph level light water and greenhouse temperature as well as humidity which is linked to thingspeak the developed smart greenhouse monitoring system was tested and evaluated to confirm its reliability functions and usability under iso evaluation criteria the respondents who include casual plant owners and experts in hydroponic gardening able to test and evaluate the prototype and the mobile application to monitor the parameters with the results of for ph level for light deg c for water temperature deg c for greenhouse temperature and for humidity with a descriptive result in both software and hardware as very good with a mean average of which means that the developed technology is useful and recommended the smart greenhouse system for hydroponic garden is used as an alternative tool solution and innovation technique towards food shortages due to climate change land shortages and low farming environments the proponents highly suggest the use of solar energy for the pump power prototype wiring should be improved the usage of a high end model of arduino to address more sensors and devices for a larger arsenal of data collected enclosures of the device to ensure safety and mobile application updates such as bug fixes and have an e manual of the whole systems ` the nutrient film technique nft method is one of the most popular hydroponic cultivation methods this method has advantages such as easier maintenance faster and optimal plant growth better use of fertilizers and less deposition the disadvantages of nft include the consumption of electrical power and the faster spread of disease therefore nft requires a good nutrient control and monitoring system to save electricity and achieve optimal growth and resistance to pests and diseases in this study a nutrient control was designed with indicators of ph and tds levels and equipped with an internet of things iot based monitoring system the control system used is the mamdani fuzzy inference system the output of the system is the active time of the ph up ph down and ab mix nutrient pumps which aim to normalize the ph and tds of nutrient liquids the experimental results show that one to three control steps are needed to normalize ph one control step has a response time of seconds and it can prevent ph up and ph down oscillations as for tds control the prediction of ab mix pump active time works accurately and tds levels can be normalized in one control step overall based on surface control simulations and real experimental data it is indicated that the control system operates very well and can normalize ph and tds to the desired normal standard ` to understand dynamic developmental processes living tissues must be imaged frequently and for extended periods of time root development is extensively studied at cellular resolution to understand basic mechanisms underlying pattern formation and maintenance in plants unfortunately ensuring continuous specimen access while preserving physiological conditions and preventing photo damage poses major barriers to measurements of cellular dynamics in indeterminately growing organs such as plant roots we present a system that integrates optical sectioning through light sheet fluorescence microscopy with hydroponic culture that enables us to image at cellular resolution a vertically growing arabidopsis root every few minutes and for several consecutive days we describe novel automated routines to track the root tip as it grows track cellular nuclei and identify cell divisions we demonstrate the system's capabilities by collecting data on divisions and nuclear dynamics ` enceladus is a saturnian satellite that should have liquid water inside of it subsurface ocean measurements and experiments on water plume from enceladus have revealed that enceladus' ocean contains several salts such as nacl on the earth salt in soil has become a serious problem for agriculture and importance of salt tolerant plants are indicated in order to test the effect of enceladus' water to terrestrial plant by hydroponic we tried to grow three salt tolerant plants ice plant swiss chard and salicornia simulating enceladus' water enceladus farm project using water with nacl and nahco which is consistent with the observations of enceladus all plants could grow if they were germinated and grown with pure water until each plant had a few leaves however growth rate can be suppressed compared with the plants cultivated with pure water because our first test was performed with loose conditions more works are needed to evaluate the effect of enceladus' water to plant growth however in addition to the works to grow plants on lunar and martian grounds enceladus' water may be used to consider properties of plant from wider environment ` containerized vertical farming is a type of vertical farming practice using hydroponics in which plants are grown in vertical layers within a mobile shipping container space limitations within shipping containers make the automation of different farming operations challenging in this paper we explore the use of cobots i e collaborative robots to automate two key farming operations namely the transplantation of saplings and the harvesting of grown plants our method uses a single demonstration from a farmer to extract the motion constraints associated with the tasks namely transplanting and harvesting and can then generalize to different instances of the same task for transplantation the motion constraint arises during insertion of the sapling within the growing tube whereas for harvesting it arises during extraction from the growing tube we present experimental results to show that using rgbd camera images obtained from an eye in hand configuration and one demonstration for each task it is feasible to perform transplantation of saplings and harvesting of leafy greens using a cobot without task specific programming
